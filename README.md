# Workshop 2

The second workshop of CS326, which covers how to use Git in a group setting.

Light could be seen breaking through the clouds about a mile away. Finally, it was the final hour of the storm. Tim looked down at his blood soaked fists and asked himself, "Can I hold on for that much longer?"
A piecing scream rang out in the distance.
"RENE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
