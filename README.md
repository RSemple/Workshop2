The second workshop of CS326, which covers how to use Git in a group setting.

Light could be seen breaking through the clouds about a mile away. Finally, it was the final hour of the storm. Tim looked down at his blood soaked fists and asked himself, "Can I hold on for that much longer?"
A piecing scream rang out in the distance.
"RENE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Alerted by the cry, Tim sprang into action.
"BARRINGTON! LEND ME YOUR STRENGTH!" Tim bellowed as his gored fists became engulfed in golden flame.
He leaped an astounding 30 feet into the air, towards the source of the scream. The jump carried him at an incredible speed and the golden flames spewing from his fists made him appear as a beautiful golden comet, soaring above the heads of soldiers locked in combat.
Nearing his landing in the center of the enemy forces, Tim raised one of his fiery fists in the air, ready to strike.
"COMET PUNCH!"
His fist came thundering down, strengthened by the speed of his jump. It made direct contact with the helmet of Thomas, general of the Cherry battalion.
"TIM AND TOM ARE TOO SIMILAR" Tim screamed as the impact from his punch created an explosion of force that shook the ground and sent flames outward in all directions. A combination of crushing earth and incinerating flames destroyed everything within a 100 meter radius.
Everything except for Thomas himself, who only had a large dent in his enchanted helmet of impenetrable immunity.
Thomas raised his eyes up towards Tim, who still had his fist locked against the helmet, and had not yet landed on the ground.
"And there's not enough room for the both of us..." Whispered Thomas.
